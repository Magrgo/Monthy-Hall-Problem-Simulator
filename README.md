## A program which can simulate the "Monty Hall problem" visually


### The Game
In the problem, you are on a game show, being asked to choose between three doors. Behind each door, there is either a prize or nothing. You choose a door. The host, Monty Hall, picks one of the other doors, which he knows has nothing behind it, and opens it, showing you the empty space. Monty then asks whether you would like to switch your choice of door to the other remaining door. Assuming you prefer to get the prize, do you choose to switch or not to switch?

The solution is that switching will let you win twice as often as sticking with the original choice, a result that seems counterintuitive to many.
